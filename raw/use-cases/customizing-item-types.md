## Customizing Item Types

## Overview

Custom item types allow you to tailor your project management tool to fit the specific needs of your organization or project. By defining your own item types, you can categorize tasks, issues, objectives, and other work items in a way that aligns with your workflow and methodologies.

## Use Case: Adding a New Custom Item Type

### Preconditions

- User must have administrative permissions to manage item types.
- User is logged into the project management tool.

### Steps

1. Navigate to the `Setup` area in the settings panel.
2. Select `Item Types` under the `Data Model` category.
3. Click on the `New Item Type` button to open the creation modal.
4. In the `Label` field, enter a name for the new item type.

  - The name must be at least three characters long.
5. (Optional) Select a `Parent Item Type` if the new item type should be a subcategory of an existing type.
6. Choose a `Badge Color` for the item type to help visually distinguish it in the project interface.
7. Click on the `Create Item Type` button to save the new item type.

### Postconditions

- The new item type will be added to the list of available item types.
- Users can now categorize their work items using the newly created custom item type.

## Tips

- **Organization**: Use custom item types to reflect your organization's structure or workflow stages.
- **Hierarchy**: Establish a hierarchy with parent and child item types for complex projects.
- **Color-Coding**: Use the badge color strategically to make the item types easy to recognize at a glance.
