## Sprint Planning in DevStride

Sprint planning is a key activity in agile project management that helps teams establish what can be delivered in a sprint and how the work will be achieved.

## Use Case: Plan a Sprint

### Pre-requisites:

- Access to DevStride with permissions to create and edit Sprints.
- The backlog should be groomed and prioritized.

### Actors:

- Product Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team

### Basic Flow:

1. **Navigate to Planning Area**
  - Go to the `Settings` section in the left-hand navigation menu.
  - Select `Data Model`.
  - Click on `Cadences`.
2. **Create a New Sprint**
  - In the Planning Cadences section, locate the `Product - Sprints/Operations` cadence.
  - Click on `New Timebox` to create a new Sprint.
3. **Define Sprint Details**
  - A modal titled `EDIT TIMEBOX` appears.
  - Select the appropriate `Cadence` from the dropdown (e.g., `Product - Sprints/Operations`).
  - Fill in the `Label` with the Sprint number (e.g., `Sprint 10.1`).
  - Set the `Start Date` and `End Date` for the sprint.
4. **Save the New Sprint**
  - After entering the details, click `Update Timebox` to save the new sprint.
5. **Assign Tasks to the Sprint**
  - Go to `Boards` > `Product - Program` > `Product - Sprints`.
  - You will see a kanban board view with columns such as `New`, `In Progress`, `Review`, and `Done`.
  - Assign tasks by dragging items from the backlog into the `New` column of the sprint.
6. **Start Sprint Execution**
  - Move items from `New` to `In Progress` as the team starts working on them.
  - Continue moving items through `Review` and then to `Done` as they are completed.

### End Condition:

- The sprint is planned with all tasks identified and assigned, ready for the team to start work.

### Post-conditions:

- The team starts working on the tasks as per the sprint plan.
- Daily stand-ups are conducted to track the progress of the sprint.
- Any adjustments needed are addressed in the sprint retrospective.
