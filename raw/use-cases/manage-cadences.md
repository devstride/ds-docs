## Use Case Overview: Creating and Managing Sprint Cadences

The aim is to establish and maintain a systematic approach to selecting the frequency and timing of program increments (PIs) and sprint cycles for optimal workflow in agile project management.

---

The process of creating and managing sprint cadences is a critical aspect of agile project management that determines the rhythmic flow of work and deliverables. It involves setting the duration of each sprint, the time between sprints, and the overarching cadence of the program operations. This use case will leverage a portfolio management tool, as illustrated in the screenshot provided, to create a visual timeline of PIs and sprints, allowing for a clear overview and easy adjustments to the cadences. Through this tool, program managers can sequence the work to be done in a structured, repeatable fashion, enabling teams to deliver incrementally and improve predictably.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Cadence Planning:**
  - Access the 'Cadences' section within the portfolio management tool settings.
  - Create a new planning cadence or edit an existing one, specifying the start and end dates for each PI and sprint cycle.
2. **Duration Settings:**
  - Define the duration for each sprint, typically lasting 2-4 weeks, ensuring it aligns with the team’s capacity and the project requirements.
  - Set the intervals between sprints if any buffer or refinement periods are required.
3. **Visual Timeline Management:**
  - Utilize the portfolio management tool to map out the sprint cycles on a visual timeline, as seen in the provided screenshot.
  - Label each sprint and PI clearly for ease of understanding and tracking.
4. **Adjustments and Alignment:**
  - Adjust the cadence settings as necessary to align with changing project scopes, team velocity, or stakeholder feedback.
  - Ensure that the sprint cadence is in harmony with other parallel-running PIs or sprints within the organization.

- The sprint cadences are clearly defined and visible within the portfolio management tool.
- Each sprint and PI is appropriately labeled and matches the team and project requirements.
- The cadence allows for seamless transitions between sprints with allocated time for planning, reviews, and retrospectives.
- The management tool reflects any adjustments made to the cadences in real-time, with changes communicated promptly to all stakeholders.

### Benefits:

- **Structured Workflow:** Creating a predictable and repeatable workflow increases efficiency and allows for better planning and forecasting.
- **Visibility:** A clear visual representation of sprints and PIs aids in communication and provides transparency for all team members.
- **Adaptability:** Easy management of sprint cadences in the tool facilitates swift adaptations to project needs without significant disruptions.
- **Performance Tracking:** Regular cadences allow for consistent tracking of team performance and more accurate velocity measurements.

Creating and managing sprint cadences through a portfolio management tool empowers agile teams to deliver value predictably and consistently, adjust to changes swiftly, and measure their progress effectively.
