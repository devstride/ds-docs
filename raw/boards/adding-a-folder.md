### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Navigate to Boards**: On your DevStride dashboard, select "Boards" from the left-hand side menu.
2. **New Folder**: Click on the "New Folder" button, usually located at the top right corner of your Boards section.
3. **Folder Details**:

  - **Parent Folder**: Select a parent folder if you want to create a sub-folder, or leave it as the main folder.
  - **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your folder.
  - **Configuration**: Decide if the folder can contain boards, cycles, or both.
  - **Cadence for Cycles**: If the folder will contain cycles, select the cadence. Cycles will be automatically created based on this cadence.
  - **Status Collection for Cycles**: Choose a status collection for organizing the cycles.
  - **Default Team for Cycles**: Optionally, you can select a default team for the cycles.
4. **Create Folder**: After entering all details, click "Create Folder".

### Efficient Use Case: Sprint Management

The most efficient use of a folder in Boards is for managing sprints in an agile workflow. Here's why:

- **Organization**: Folders can represent different sprints, with each containing boards that reflect the sprint's goals.
- **Clarity**: Having a separate folder for each sprint helps team members quickly locate their current work and understand what's upcoming.
- **Automation**: By setting up a cadence, new cycles (sprints) are automatically created, ensuring consistent sprint durations and easier planning.
- **Status Tracking**: Assigning a status collection to cycles within a folder helps maintain consistency in how sprint progress is reported and tracked.

### Conclusion

Using folders in Boards to manage sprints ensures that each sprint is clearly defined within your project management tool. It enhances the visibility of tasks, centralizes communication on sprint-related work items, and ultimately supports a more organized and efficient agile process.
