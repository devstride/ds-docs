## Introducing Board Hierarchy, 2D Boards, and More!

Get ready for a game-changing update in DevStride! We're rolling out new features and significant improvements that will streamline your project management experience even further.

## Major Updates

### Board Hierarchy Overhaul

- **Revamped Navigation with Folder-Based Structures:** Experience a fresh way of organizing your work with boards and cycles now residing within a newly introduced folder system, enhancing your workflow with improved clarity and structure.
- **Flexible Cycle Creation with Cadences:** Set cycles (sprints) to align with a cadence and automatically generate for each folder using that cadence, as defined in the organization settings.
- **Cross-Team Work Item Assignment:** Assign work items from any team to any board, breaking down barriers and enhancing collaboration.

### Introducing 2D Boards

- **Innovative Board View:** Our 2D board view lets you categorize and visualize items by different fields on the X and Y axes. Organize by assignee, priority, and more, for a comprehensive overview.

## Feature Enhancements

- **Sortable Item Table Columns:** Click column headers in the items table to sort, simplifying data management.
- **Enhanced Text Visibility:** Item titles in tables are now in semi-bold for better readability at a glance.
- **Keyboard Navigation in Data Grids:** We've enhanced arrow key and cursor navigation for editing large batches of items more comfortably.
- **Shortcut for Gantt Parent Dates:** Use shift-click to quickly set Gantt date cells to match their parent dates, saving time and ensuring consistency.

## Performance and Usability Improvements

- **My Work Page Stability:** Fixed the issue causing the My Work page to freeze, ensuring smooth operation.
- **Drag and Drop Scrolling:** Improved the auto-scroll behavior in tables during drag and drop actions for a smoother user experience.
- **Overdue Item Visibility in Gantt:** Overdue items now appear in red in the Gantt view, mirroring the behavior seen in the map and item lists for immediate recognition.
- **Mobile Usability Enhancements:** Conducted an extensive audit to improve interaction with DevStride on mobile devices, making it more accessible when you're on the go.
- **Auto-Select Item Types in Reports:** When filtering by board or cycle, the item type selector now automatically adjusts to show relevant types.
- **Date Synchronization with Cycle Changes:** Dates on items now automatically sync with changes to their associated board or cycle.

This update is all about making your project management workflow more intuitive, collaborative, and efficient. Dive in and discover how these new features can transform your day-to-day operations.
