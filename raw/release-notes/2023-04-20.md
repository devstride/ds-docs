## Unveiling DevStride's Newest Release: AI Chat Assistant, Refined Permissions, Dark Mode, and more!

We're excited to announce the latest update for DevStride, your favorite project management application! This release has added new features and enhancements that will significantly improve your team's productivity and collaboration.

## New Features and Enhancements

1. **AI Chat Assistant:** We've integrated an advanced AI chat assistant with deep knowledge of DevStride. Users can now ask questions about the platform, and our chat assistant will provide instant answers and guidance. This new feature will enable your team to work more efficiently and resolve queries faster.
2. **Refined Permissions for Workstreams and Teams:** To give system administrators more control over work visibility, we've introduced refined permissions for both Core Workstreams and Teams. Now, you can assign specific teams to each Core Workstream and restrict access to private team's cycles and boards, ensuring only relevant members can view their contents. This enhancement strengthens project security and ensures your teams focus on their assigned tasks.
3. **Dark Mode:** We're excited to introduce Dark Mode for DevStride, providing a more comfortable and eye-friendly experience during those late-night work sessions. You can easily switch between light and dark themes through the settings menu, customizing the look of your workspace to match your preference.
4. **Improved Keyboard Navigation:** We know how important it is to work quickly and efficiently, so we've improved the keyboard navigation within the workspace drawer. Users can now update item properties without leaving their keyboards, streamlining the process and saving valuable time.

## Bug Fixes

- **Text Editor Tab Key Fixes:** We've addressed issues related to using the tab key in the text editor. With these fixes, users can now navigate and edit text more easily, leading to a more enjoyable and efficient editing experience.

As always, we'd like to thank our users for their valuable feedback and suggestions, which have helped us make DevStride even better. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for future updates, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.
