## Introducing Our Latest Update: Enhanced Workstreams, New Reports, and More

We are excited to announce a new update that will bring major improvements to your experience with our platform. With this update, we've focused on enhancing Workstreams and Work Items, adding new insightful reports, and fixing some pesky bugs. Let's dive in!

## Features & Enhancements

1. **Start Dates for Workstreams and Work Items**: We've added the ability to set start dates for Workstreams and Work Items, making it easier to plan and manage your work schedule.
2. **Workstream and Item Dependencies**: Introducing the "Relationships" popup in the subheader of the workspace, where you can now create dependencies between Workstreams and items to streamline your workflow.
3. **New Reports**: We've added some insightful new reports to help you track your team's performance more effectively. These include:
  - **Lead/Cycle Time**: Measure the average time it takes to start, work on, and complete tasks over a given period.
  - **Custom Cycle Time**: Calculate the average time it takes for work items to move between any two lanes over a given period.
  - **Churn**: Compare the number of items added vs. removed from a list of cycles or the number of items created vs. completed over a given period.
  - **Velocity**: See how much work was committed vs. completed for a list of selected cycles.
4. **Improved Comments Accessibility**: We've moved the comments section under the description in the Workspace to make discussions and context tracking more accessible.
5. **Deleting Cycles and Boards**: You can now delete Cycles and Boards, allowing you to keep your workspace clean and organized.
6. **Scrollbar Visibility**: To improve navigation, we've ensured that scrollbars are always visible in selection fields if there are more items than the height of the popup.

## Bug Fixes

1. **Tag Duplication**: Tags will now be included when an item is duplicated, ensuring all necessary information is carried over.
2. **Comment Count**: We've fixed the comment count issue, ensuring accurate numbers are displayed when comments and replies are created and deleted.

We hope these improvements will help you work more efficiently and effectively on our platform. As always, we appreciate your feedback and look forward to continuing to enhance your experience.
