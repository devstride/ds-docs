## DevStride Quick Update: Workspace Navigation and UI Enhancements

A new set of updates is here for DevStride, focusing on improving your organizational capabilities and streamlining workspace navigation. Here’s what’s new in this release:

## Enhancements and New Features

- **Easier Folder Management**: We've added context menu options that simplify moving folders, making organization quick and intuitive.
- **Board Folder Mobility**: Fixed an issue that previously prevented board folders from being moved to the root, now allowing full flexibility in folder placement.
- **Streamlined Board Selector**: Board selectors now automatically collapse empty sections, reducing clutter and focusing your attention where it's needed.
- **Search Functionality on Boards Page**: Find the items you need within a board without hassle using the new search bar directly on the boards page.
- **Intuitive Workspace Transitions**: When closing a workspace that was accessed via navigation from another workspace, you'll now be conveniently taken back to the originating workspace.
- **Sidebar Tree Structure for Folders**: The folder browser has evolved into a tree-like structure in the sidebar of the boards page, offering better context and clarity for your projects.
- **Collapsible Quick Access Section**: Manage your screen space more effectively with the ability to collapse the quick access section as needed.

These updates aim to make your project management smoother, with less time spent on finding or rearranging your board folders, and more on actual productivity. As always, we value your feedback and are here to help with any questions or further improvements you’d like to see.
