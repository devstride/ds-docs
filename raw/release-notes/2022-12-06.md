**Features & Enhancements**

- We added a toggle in analytics charts so that you can switch between the chart view and and the data table transaction view.
- Added a quick add button to the "New" lane on the Work > Board view and also the current tab on the Plan > Cycles view so you can create work items faster.
- We've added a "Recents" button the the page header that lists all recently viewed items and workstreams for easy access.
- We've also added a "Recents" button to the workstream location picker so you don't have to click through the map tree every time you create an item.
- We've added sorting to both the Plan > Cycles and Work > Board views.

**Bug Fixes**

- Fixes the global search so it finds items and workstreams correctly.
