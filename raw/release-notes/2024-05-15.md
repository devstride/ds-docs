## Request Forms and Enhanced Collaboration

We're excited to announce the latest updates to our Portfolio/Project Management application, designed to enhance your workflow and collaboration experience.

### Introducing Item Request Forms

One of the most significant additions in this release is the introduction of Item Request Forms. These forms allow you to create custom links that can be shared with internal users or external stakeholders, enabling them to submit requests that automatically create work items in your portfolio. This feature streamlines the intake process, reduces manual errors, and increases transparency across teams.

### Other Notable Enhancements

- **Improved Dependency Visibility:** Get a clearer picture of your item's dependencies with our enhanced dependency status feature. In the workspace, you can now easily see the status of dependent items and identify any blockers.
- **Quick Cycle Navigation:** Navigate between cycles on the board page with ease using our new arrow buttons.
- **Time Spent Field in Automations:** Automate your workflows more efficiently with the added time spent field in automations.

### Additional Updates and Fixes

- We've added a warning to prevent users from marking items as done when they have incomplete child items or subtasks.
- The system now remembers the last item type selected in the quick add dialog for a more seamless user experience.
- We've fixed a bug where items were not selectable in the parent hierarchy condition in automation.
- Gantt performance has been enhanced for faster loading times.
- Inactive team members no longer appear on boards, and archived teams are now clearly marked with an "archived" tag.
- We've resolved an issue where archived item types were incorrectly showing up in reports.

These updates are designed to improve your overall experience, increase collaboration, and streamline your workflow. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.
