## New Features

### Item Dependencies and Due Date in Item Request Forms

We've added the ability to include item dependencies and due dates in item request forms. Admins can now configure and publish forms to capture more detailed information for creating work items.

## Enhancements

### Recent Boards Section in Select Board Menu

The recent section in the select board menu will now be open by default, displaying the latest three boards with an option to show more. This makes accessing your frequently used boards faster and more convenient.

### View Type Switcher on Small Screens

We've ensured that the view type switcher on the boards page is now visible on small screens.

### Auto-Loading First Folder on Boards Index Page

The first folder on the boards index page will now automatically load, ensuring the page isn't blank and providing a more seamless user experience.
