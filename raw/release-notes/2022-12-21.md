We are excited to announce some new features and enhancements to our platform!

First, we've added support for Kanban workflows, allowing teams to use boards to manage their work instead of just cycles. This will give teams more flexibility in how they organize and track their work.

Additionally, we've added filters for due dates on all relevant pages. This will allow users to easily scope their data based on item timelines, making it easier to stay on top of deadlines and prioritize their work.

We've also made some important bug fixes, including fixing a bug in the cycle reports where updating the team was not loading the correct data, and fixing the activity log range filter. We've also addressed a bug where some pages would say a sort was applied when it wasn't.

We hope these enhancements will make it even easier for teams to manage their work and stay organized. Look out for more new features coming very soon!
