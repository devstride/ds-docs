## Customizing Table Columns

The "Manage Columns" window allows you to select which columns you want to display in your work items table:

- To include a column in your view, make sure the checkbox next to the column name is ticked.
- To exclude a column, simply uncheck the box next to the column name.

Here is a list of available columns you can toggle:

- `Due Date`: The deadline for the work item.
- Additional options include `Point Estimate`, `Time Estimate`, `Time Spent`, `Priority`, `Tags`, `Release`, `For Customer`, and `Blocked Reason`.

Once you have made your selections:

1. Click the `Apply` button to update the table view.
2. The work items table will refresh to display only the columns you've chosen.
