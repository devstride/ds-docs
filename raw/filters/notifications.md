## Filters in the "Notifications" Section of DevStride

The **Notifications** section in DevStride is designed to keep you informed about updates and changes that are relevant to you. To help manage this information, DevStride offers a set of filters. Here's how to use them effectively.

## Accessing Filters

To access the filters in the Notifications section:

1. Open the **Notifications** section from the main sidebar.
2. Find and click on the `Filters` button located in the toolbar near the top of the notifications list.

## Available Filters

The Filters dropdown provides several categories to help you sort your notifications:

- **Activity**: Filter notifications based on the type of activity (e.g., assigned, unassigned, updated, commented).
- **Range**: Choose a time range to display notifications from a specific period.
- **Team**: View notifications related to a particular team or group.
- **User**: Display notifications that involve specific users.
- **Role**: Filter notifications by the roles assigned to users (e.g., Developer, Manager, QA).

## Applying Filters

To apply a filter to your notifications:

1. Click on the desired filter category within the dropdown menu.
2. Select the criteria you want to apply from the submenu.
3. The notification list will automatically update to reflect your selection.

## Combining Multiple Filters

You can narrow down the notifications by applying multiple filters:

1. Apply the first filter as described above.
2. Click on the `Filters` button again and select another filter category.
3. Choose your criteria, and the list will update to show notifications that match all selected filters.

## Clearing Filters

To remove applied filters and return to the unfiltered view in DevStride, you have two options:

1. **Clear Individual Filters**:
  - Each applied filter appears as a tag near the top of the section.
  - Click the `X` on a filter tag to remove that specific filter.
2. **Clear Filters from the Filter Menu**:
  - For specific that have a detailed filter menu, you can clear selections directly within the menu.
  - Open the filter by clicking on it, and then click the `Clear` button within the filter menu to remove the selections for that specific filter.

After clearing filters, the view will update to show all items or notifications, depending on the section you are in.

Remember that clearing filters can help you reset your view to its default state, allowing you to start a new search or overview of all items.

## Filtering Tips

- Use the **Show read** toggle to hide or display notifications that you have already read.
- Filters can be combined in any order to provide a customized view of your notifications.

By effectively using filters, you can stay on top of the notifications that are most relevant to you without being overwhelmed by the volume of updates.
