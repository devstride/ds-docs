## User-Defined Item Types, Enhanced Completion Stats, UI/UX Overhauls, and More!

In our latest DevStride update, we're excited to bring you significant enhancements that offer more customization, clearer insights, and a smoother user experience. Let's dive into the new changes:

## New Features and Enhancements

1. **User-Defined Item Types and Child Items:** A major system improvement! Define your own item types for work items and create hierarchies with child items in the settings.

## Bug Fixes

- **Gantt Chart Date Calculations:** Fixed issues with calculating the minimum and maximum dates for workstreams on the Gantt charts.
- **Priority Update Automation:** A minor bug with the priority updated automation has been corrected.

We're committed to continuously improving DevStride to fit your project management needs. A big shout-out to our users for their invaluable feedback. If you experience any issues or have suggestions, our support team is ready to jump in and help!

## DevStride Release Notes: Sharable Gantt Charts, Item Watchers, and Enhanced Workstream Tracking!

Dive into the latest updates of DevStride! We've been busy refining features to further empower you in managing your projects seamlessly. Here's a look at what's new:

### New Features and Enhancements

1. **Sharable Gantt Charts:**
Simplifying collaboration is key, and with that in mind, we've introduced the ability to share links to specific Gantt charts. Now, when you want to direct someone to a particular Gantt chart, just share the unique link. No more navigating and searching – get straight to the chart you need!
2. **Watch Work Items:**
Staying informed on project changes has never been easier. Users can now "watch" specific work items, allowing them to receive notifications on selected item changes and events. This feature ensures you're always in the loop, especially for critical tasks or items you're deeply invested in.
3. **Manual Percent Completed for Workstreams:**
We understand that project progress isn't always about the quantity of items done. Now, users have the flexibility to manually set a "percent completed" for workstreams. This means you can define progress based on your judgment, rather than strictly on the number of items, time estimates, or points completed.

We're dedicated to enhancing your project management experience. A huge thanks to our user community for the ongoing feedback, which helps drive our feature development. If you have any queries or suggestions, our support team is always eager to help!
