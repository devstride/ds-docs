## Configuring Item Types

### How to Access Item Types

#### Step 1: Access Settings

- Navigate to Settings: First, locate and click on the "Settings" option, which can be found in the side toolbar on the left side of the DevStride platform.

#### Step 2: Locate Item Types

- Open Item Types: Once in the "Settings" area, click on "Item Types" listed under the Data Model category. This option is positioned on the left-hand side of the settings screen.

#### Step 3: Manage Item Types

- Customize Item Types: Upon opening "Item Types", a window will appear where you can manage and customize your item types. Here, you can create new item types, edit existing ones, and define their hierarchy and properties.

### How to Customize

#### Understanding the Default Item Type

- **General Item Type**: Initially, you'll notice a default item type named "General" in DevStride. This type cannot be deleted but can be customized. You can rename the label and change the color. All unassigned work items default to "General."

#### Starting Customization

- **New Item Type**: To customize, click the green "New Item Type" button at the upper right corner of the screen.
- **Customization Window**: A pop-up box will appear for editing the name and placing your new item type within your desired hierarchy.

#### Choosing Colors and Creating Item Types

- **Color Selection**: Within the customization window, select a color to visually distinguish this item type.
- **Create New Item Type**: After setting the name and color, click "Create New Item Type" to add it to the system.

##### Developing Your Hierarchy

- **Repeat Process**: Develop a comprehensive hierarchy by repeating the customization steps.
- **Ongoing Customization**: Edit any time by clicking the pencil icon next to an item type label. Delete with the red "X" icon.

#### Time Tracking Feature

- **Clock Icon**: A clock icon near the label indicates the ability to track time for tasks within that item type, aiding in management and reporting.
