The **User Time Completed** feature, found in the report section, is a valuable tool for tracking productivity and workload. It allows you to select an assignee and view the tasks and/or subtasks they have completed, along with the total hours they've spent on these items, within a specified date range.

This feature is particularly useful for project managers and team members, as it provides clear insights into individual performance and time management. By using 'User Time Completed', you can ensure that workloads are balanced, identify areas where additional support may be needed, and acknowledge the efforts of team members. It's an essential component for maintaining efficiency and fostering a collaborative and accountable team environment.
