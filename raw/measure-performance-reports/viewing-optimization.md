## Measure Performance: Getting Started with Reports in DevStride

Unlock clarity and confidence with real-time portfolio insights in DevStride's Measure Performance Module

### 📊 What Is the Measure Performance Module?

The Measure Performance module in DevStride is your go-to hub for understanding how work is progressing across your entire portfolio — from teams and products to strategic initiatives. It turns all your work data into clear, actionable insights, without the need to dig through individual items or spreadsheets.

Whether you're a project manager, product owner, or executive, Measure Performance helps you answer:

- Are we on track?
- Where are the bottlenecks?
- How fast are we delivering value?
- What’s trending in the right (or wrong) direction?

### 🧭 What You’ll See

When you open Measure Performance, you’ll find a collection of powerful report types, each designed to give you a different lens on your work. Here’s what’s available:

#### Progress Reports

**Current Progress** – See how much work is done, in progress, or not started across any level.

**Trending Progress** – Track how your progress is changing over time.

#### Efficiency Reports

**Cycle Time** – How long work takes from start to finish.

**Throughput** – How much work is getting done in a given time period.

**Cumulative Flow** – Visualize work in each stage over time to detect bottlenecks.

#### Forecasting & Planning

Burn Down – See if you’re on track to complete work by a deadline.

**Burn Up** – Similar to burn down, but focused on value delivered.

**Velocity** – Understand your team's consistent delivery pace over cycles.

#### Health & Quality

**Churn** – Identify rework or churned items that may signal scope or quality issues.

**Time Spent** – Track how much time is being logged against work.

Each report includes interactive charts, filters, and underlying data you can drill into.

### 🛠️ What You Can Do in Measure Performance

#### 1. Filter What Matters - with filter selections or AI prompts

Use powerful filters and/or AI prompts to slice the data by:

- Agile level (Epics, Features, Stories, etc.)
- Teams or individuals
- Boards, cycles, or time frames
- Tags, priorities, statuses, custom fields, and more

This allows you to zoom in on:

- Just your team’s work
- A specific initiative or customer project
- Only unplanned or delayed work
- Work tagged to strategic goals
- You can mix and match filters to answer almost any question.

#### 2. Choose How to Measure

Want to see report results in story points, estimated hours, actual time logged, or just item counts?

You can customize how data is aggregated:

- Count of items
- Estimated Time
- Estimated Points
- Actual Time

This flexibility makes reports useful for both strategic planning and day-to-day operations.

#### 3. Drill Into the Details

Each chart isn’t just a pretty picture — you can click to see the actual items behind the data. Items are editable, making it even easier to act on reporting.

Need to know:

- Which items are causing delays?
- What work was completed in the last 2 weeks?
- Which initiatives are behind?

You’ll get granular, interactive transaction records to support data-driven decisions.

#### 4. Export or Share Your Data

Need to share a report outside DevStride? You can export:

- Full data tables
- Charts
- Filtered views

Whether for leadership reviews or team retrospectives, sharing insights is easy.
