# What is Cumulative Flow?

> 

## Overview

---

Cumulative Flow is a visual representation of the flow of work items through a team's workflow over time. It is a chart that shows the number of work items in each lane of the workflow at any given time, and it provides a snapshot of how work is progressing through the system.

The chart is built by plotting the number of work items in each lane of the workflow over time. The horizontal axis represents time, while the vertical axis represents the number of work items. Each lane of the workflow is represented by a different colored band.
