# Statuses and WIP Limiters

> 

### 1 - Create Status

To create a status, click the green "New" button next to 1 - Create Status. Statuses New and Done are reserved by the system and cannot be changed, while other statuses are user-defined. Examples of user-defined statuses include:

Approved
In Progress
Pending Release
Review
Review Req

### 2 - Group into Collections

Once you've created statuses, you can group them into collections, and set a WIP Limiter for each status. WIP stands for Work in Progress, and a WIP Limiter is a tool used to control the amount of work that is currently being handled in a production process, project, or workflow.

An example of how DevStride will warn you've passed your WIP Limit:

### 3 - Assign Collection to Teams

You can assign collections of lanes and WIP limiters to various team within your organization. Leave it to default, or assign a "simple" collection containing the following lanes:

New
In Progress
Done
For more elaborate collections, click the dropdown menu under Collections to manually assign a lane collection to each team.
