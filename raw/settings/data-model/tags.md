# Tags

> 

To configure tags, go to Settings and on the left navigation bar, and under Data Model, click Tags.

Create Tags in the Manage Tags area by clicking the New button next to 1 - Create Tags.

Note that tags **Blocked** and **Bug** are reserved by Devstride's system and cannot be changed or removed. You can create as many user-defined tags as you'd like. Some examples:

- Backend
- Design
- Documentation
- Frontend
- Rejected
- Research
- Roadmap Item

You can delete tags by clicking the red **"X"** button next to each user-defined tag.
