## Integrations

### Overview

Integrations in project management software refer to the ability to connect and transfer data between different software tools and applications used in project management.

In today's complex and interconnected digital environment, it is common for project teams to use multiple software tools to manage their work, such as project management software, time-tracking software, communication tools, and many others.

Integrations allow these tools to "talk" to each other and share data seamlessly, which can save time and improve accuracy in project management.

For example, an integration between project management software and a time-tracking tool can automatically update a project's progress based on the time logged by team members.

To access the Integrations section in DevStride, head to the Settings button positioned on the platform's lower left corner. Upon selecting Integrations from the header, you'll be presented with a list of integrations on the left. Conversely, the right side showcases the organizations already integrated with your selected integrations.

### Github

Integrating GitHub in a project management software involves setting up a connection between the two tools and configuring the settings to enable data exchange between them.

Once the integration is set up, any changes made in GitHub will be reflected
in the project management software, and vice versa. This can help streamline project workflows and improve collaboration among team members.
