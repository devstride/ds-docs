Customizing your notifications in DevStride empowers you to manage your workflow efficiently, stay informed about critical updates, and engage with your team and stakeholders effectively. The ability to tailor notifications to your specific needs ensures that you are always up-to-date with the information that matters most to your role, enhancing your project management capabilities and driving project success.

For example, as a project manager, you may want to receive real-time notifications whenever a critical task is completed or requires urgent attention. Customizing your notifications allows you to receive instant alerts when a task moves from "In Progress" to "Review" or "Done," enabling you to promptly review completed work, provide feedback, and keep the project on track.

#### E-mail Notifications

When a user is assigned a task or when a specific event occurs within the project, the software automatically generates an e-mail notification and sends it to the designated recipient(s). These notifications are typically customizable, allowing users to define their preferences regarding the types of notifications they wish to receive.

E-mail notifications in project management software are designed to ensure that team members stay updated and remain aware of important project developments. They provide timely and relevant information, helping individuals prioritize their work, take necessary actions, and stay aligned with the project's progress.

By leveraging e-mail notifications, team members can easily stay connected with the project, collaborate effectively, and maintain visibility into their responsibilities and upcoming deadlines.

To enable e-mail notifications in DevStride, click the E-mail box under Notify Me of Direct Mentions Via in the Notifications Preferences page.
