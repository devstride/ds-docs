## Setting User Roles in DevStride

Managing user roles is essential for maintaining the right level of access and responsibilities within DevStride. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to set and modify user roles within the platform.

## Accessing User Settings

First, navigate to the 'Settings' section on the left-hand panel of your DevStride dashboard. This panel is usually at the bottom of the sidebar.

## Navigating to User Management

Within the 'Settings' menu, click on the 'Users' submenu under the 'ORGANIZATION' section. This will open a list of users associated with your DevStride account.

## Assigning and Changing Roles

1. **Locating the User**: Find the user whose role you want to set or change. You can scroll through the list or use the search function at the top of the 'Users' section.
2. **Role Selection**:
  - To the right of the user's name, locate the 'ROLE' column.
  - Click on the dropdown menu next to the user's current role. You will see options like 'Admin' and 'Member'.
3. **Changing the Role**:
  - Select the appropriate role for the user.
  - 'Admin' roles typically have more permissions and access to settings than 'Members'.
4. **Saving Changes**: After selecting the new role, it should automatically save. If there is a save button or confirmation prompt, make sure to confirm the changes.
5. **Confirmation**:
  - Ensure that the role has been updated by checking the 'ROLE' column next to the user’s name.
  - It should now reflect the new role you have assigned.

## Best Practices for Role Assignment

- **Understand Roles**: Before assigning roles, ensure you understand the permissions associated with each role within DevStride.
- **Limit Admins**: Only grant 'Admin' access to users who need it for their tasks. Having too many admins can lead to security risks.
- **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review user roles to ensure they align with current job functions and responsibilities.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while trying to set or change roles, use the 'Support' button located in the help section of the sidebar or directly reach out via the in-app chat feature.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage user roles within DevStride to ensure that everyone has the access they need to work efficiently and securely.
