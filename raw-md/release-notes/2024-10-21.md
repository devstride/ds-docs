## New Features and Improvements

### Display Custom Field Assets
In the Assets tab inside the Item Drawer we added a new Grouping that will show all Custom Field Assets in addition to other assets associated with that item. This enhances accessibility by having all assets related to the item in one place.

### Enhanced UX for Item Request Settings
We made some improvemenst to the user experience when configuring the settings for Item Request Forms. 

## Bug Fixes and Enhancements

### Duplicate Assets
We fixed an issue where assets were appearing twice when the "Display Parent Assets" checkbox was selected in Assets tab. This ensures that the item list displays correctly without unnecessary duplicates.
