    - **On Work Item**: Choose which changes to an item will trigger a notification (e.g., Assets modified, Assignee modified).
    - **Roles**: Specify the role you must have in the item for the notification to be sent to you (e.g., Assignee, Creator, Watcher, Participant).
    - Users can set these notifications to be sent to the DevStride Notification Center or their email.
