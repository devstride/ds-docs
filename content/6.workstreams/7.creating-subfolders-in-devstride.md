## How Subfolders Appear in the System

Once a subfolder is created, it will appear in the main project area. The appearance is as follows:

### In the Sidebar Navigation
- The new subfolder will be listed under the parent folder, indented to indicate its hierarchy.
- An icon next to the subfolder name indicates if it can contain boards or cycles.

### In the Project Overview
- The subfolder will also appear in the main content area of the project.
- It will display next to existing folders or boards, with the option to expand or collapse to view contents.

### In the Quick Access Section
- You can star your subfolder for it to appear in the **Quick Access** area for easier navigation.

By following these steps, you can efficiently create subfolders and keep your project space organized and accessible.
