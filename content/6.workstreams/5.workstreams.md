## Filters in the "Workstreams" Section of DevStride

The **Workstreams** section in DevStride helps teams organize and visualize their workflow in a structured manner. Filtering within Workstreams allows users to focus on specific areas or tasks that require attention. Below is a guide to using filters in this section.

## Accessing Filters

To use filters within the Workstreams section:

1. Navigate to the **Workstreams** section from the sidebar.
2. Look for the `Filters` button at the top of the workstream list, next to the `Sort` and `Options` buttons.

## Types of Filters Available

You can apply several types of filters to sort through the items in Workstreams:

- **Item Type**: Filter by the type of items (e.g., Task, Story, Bug).
- **Team**: Show items that are associated with a particular team.
- **Assignee**: Filter items by the team member they are assigned to.
- **Priority**: Arrange items by their priority status (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
- **Tag**: View items tagged with specific keywords or labels.
- **Field**: Use custom fields to filter items.
- **Cycle**: Display items that are part of a particular cycle.
- **Board**: Filter by the board status of items (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
- **Status**: Sort by the current status of the workstream items.
- **Start Date**: Filter items based on when they were started.
- **Due Date**: View items by their due date.
- **Time Spent**: See items based on the time logged against them.
- **Unplanned**: Filter to show items that have not been planned within a cycle.

## Applying Filters

To apply a filter:

1. Click on the `Filters` button to open the dropdown menu.
2. Select the filter category you wish to apply.
3. Choose the specific criteria from the options available.
4. The list of items will update to match the selected filters.

## Combining Multiple Filters

To further refine your view, you can combine filters:

1. Apply the first filter as outlined above.
2. Click on the `Filters` button again to apply additional filters.
3. Your workstream will now only display items that meet all the criteria you have set.

## Clearing Filters

To remove applied filters and return to the unfiltered view in DevStride, you have two options:

1. **Clear Individual Filters**: 
   - Each applied filter appears as a tag near the top of the section. 
   - Click the `X` on a filter tag to remove that specific filter.

2. **Clear Filters from the Filter Menu**: 
   - For specific that have a detailed filter menu, you can clear selections directly within the menu. 
   - Open the filter by clicking on it, and then click the `Clear` button within the filter menu to remove the selections for that specific filter.

After clearing filters, the view will update to show all items or notifications, depending on the section you are in.

Remember that clearing filters can help you reset your view to its default state, allowing you to start a new search or overview of all items.

## Using Filters Effectively

Leveraging filters in Workstreams can significantly enhance team productivity by allowing members to focus on specific tasks, leading to better workflow management and task prioritization.
