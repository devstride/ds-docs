### Effort Point Estimation 

DevStride supports the use of point estimation. Point estimation allows you to enter an estimate that is proportional to an assignable set of hours that are needed to complete a task. Assigning point estimates are not required in DevStride but are a helpful way to implement agile project management.

Update the Point Estimate of an item by opening the workspace and clicking the Point Estimate bar under Assigned to.

In the Settings page, choose a team and enable or disable effort point estimation. 

### Time Estimation 

Just like with Point Estimate, you can also update the Time estimate. The path is similar - open the workspace, and click Time Estimate. Then, enter the amount of estimated hours to complete an item by dividing them in three possible outcomes:

- optimistic
- likely
- pessimistic

Using the PERT formula, an aggregate calculation will be determined, showing the estimated time of completion, with a +/- margin of error.

You will be able to view the Range, Estimate, and Confidence intervals before clicking Save Estimate.

You can also edit the Time Estimate by right-clicking on the work item. Go to Edit -> Time Estimate and enter values in the respective boxes. Time estimate ranges are user-defined you can add or remove them in the 1 - Create Range column under Manage Time Estimation.
