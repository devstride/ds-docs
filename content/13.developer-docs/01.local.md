# ds local

Local development commands. No AWS authentication required.

---

### local run backend

**Purpose:** Start the backend Hono HTTP server on port 3001.

**When to use:** Every development session. This is the primary backend process the frontend talks to.

::callout{type="info"}
The local backend connects to your cloud-hosted PostgreSQL (Neon) and DynamoDB. Only the HTTP server runs on your machine. JWT verification and membership lookups are skipped in local mode.
::

---

### local run frontend

**Purpose:** Start the Vite frontend dev server on port 8080.

**When to use:** Every development session when working on frontend features.

::callout{type="warning"}
Requires `frontend/.env.local` to exist. Run `ds cloud outputs pull` if missing.
::

---

### local run services

**Purpose:** Start local Docker services (DynamoDB Local) via `docker-compose up -d`.

**When to use:** When running backend integration tests that need a local DynamoDB instance.

::callout{type="info"}
Requires Docker to be installed and running.
::

---

### local generate command

**Purpose:** Generate CQRS command boilerplate (command class, service handler, init registration).

**When to use:** When adding a new write operation (create, update, delete) to a backend module.

```bash
ds local generate command <name> -m <module>
# Example: ds local generate command create-item -m item
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-m, --module <module>` | Backend module (required) |
| `-f, --force` | Overwrite existing files |

::callout{type="info"}
After generating, you still need to implement the business logic in the service file and add the Hono route handler.
::

---

### local generate query

**Purpose:** Generate CQRS query boilerplate (query class, service handler, init registration).

**When to use:** When adding a new read operation (get, list, search) to a backend module.

```bash
ds local generate query <name> -m <module>
# Example: ds local generate query get-items -m item
```

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-m, --module <module>` | Backend module (required) |
| `-f, --force` | Overwrite existing files |

---

### local generate api-client

**Purpose:** Generate TypeScript API client types from backend Hono routes.

**When to use:** After adding, changing, or removing backend API endpoints.

::callout{type="warning"}
Skipping this after route changes causes compile-time type mismatches in the frontend.
::

---

### local generate api-docs

**Purpose:** Generate API documentation from backend route definitions.

**When to use:** When API docs need to be updated after route changes.

---

### local check inits

**Purpose:** Find backend command/query handlers that are not registered in their module's init file.

**When to use:** Before deploying, especially after adding new commands or queries.

::callout{type="danger"}
A missing init registration is a silent failure -- the handler exists in code but is never called at runtime. Your endpoint will appear to do nothing.
::

---

### local check correlation-ids

**Purpose:** Find API handlers missing `setCorrelationId` calls.

**When to use:** Before deploying after adding new API handlers.

::callout{type="warning"}
Missing correlation IDs make it very difficult to trace requests through the event-driven architecture during production debugging.
::

---

### local check events

**Purpose:** Find domain events that are emitted but have no registered handler.

**When to use:** After adding new domain events or event handlers. Unhandled events are silently dropped.

---

### local check stack-events

**Purpose:** Find event handlers in code that are missing from the Pulumi infrastructure definition.

**When to use:** Before deploying infrastructure changes.

::callout{type="danger"}
Events that exist in code but not in infrastructure work locally but fail silently when deployed -- the event fires but no Lambda is triggered.
::
