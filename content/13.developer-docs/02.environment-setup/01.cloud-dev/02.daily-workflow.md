# Daily Workflow

Once your cloud environment is set up, here's how to use it day-to-day.

## Starting Your Day

### 1. Start Your Instance (if stopped)

```bash
./ds cloud-dev start
```

Wait for the instance to be running:

```bash
./ds cloud-dev list
```

### 2. Connect

```bash
./ds cloud-dev ssh
# Or use the configured alias:
ssh devstride-yourname
```

### 3. Start Development

```bash
cd ~/dev/devstride
git pull                # Get latest changes
./ds run backend        # Start backend server
```

In a second terminal (or tmux):

```bash
./ds run ui             # Start frontend
```

## Remote Commands

Run commands on your cloud instance from your local terminal:

```bash
# Start/stop services
./ds cloud-dev start-backend     # Start backend (./ds run backend)
./ds cloud-dev stop-backend      # Stop backend process
./ds cloud-dev start-frontend    # Start frontend (./ds run ui)
./ds cloud-dev stop-frontend     # Stop frontend process

# Database operations
./ds cloud-dev run-migrations    # Run database migrations
./ds cloud-dev reset-database    # Reset database from source
```

## End of Day

Stop your instance to save costs:

```bash
./ds cloud-dev stop
```

Your data is preserved on the EBS volume. When stopped, you only pay for storage (~$8/month).

## Checking Status

```bash
# List all your instances
./ds cloud-dev list

# Get connection info
./ds cloud-dev info
```

## Multiple Instances

Create additional instances for different work:

```bash
./ds cloud-dev create -i 2       # Creates devstride-dev-yourname-2
./ds cloud-dev ssh -i 2          # Connect to instance 2
./ds cloud-dev stop -i 2         # Stop instance 2
```

## Using VS Code Remote

1. Install the "Remote - SSH" extension in VS Code
2. Open Command Palette: `Remote-SSH: Connect to Host`
3. Select `devstride-yourname` (automatically configured)
4. Open folder: `/home/ec2-user/dev/devstride`

## Using Claude Code

Claude Code is pre-installed on your instance:

```bash
# First time: authenticate
claude

# Then use normally
claude "explain this function"
```

## Tips

### Keep SSH Alive

The SSH config is automatically set with keepalive settings, but if you experience disconnects, add to your local `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host devstride-*
    ServerAliveInterval 60
    ServerAliveCountMax 3
```

### Use tmux for Persistent Sessions

```bash
# Start a named session
tmux new -s dev

# Detach: Ctrl+B, then D
# Reattach:
tmux attach -t dev
```

### Quick Backend Restart

```bash
# On the instance
pkill -f 'sst dev' && ./ds run backend
```
