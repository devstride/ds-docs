## Overview

* * *
Cycle time is an essential metric in Agile software development, indicating the total time required to complete a task, user story, or feature from the moment work begins to its final readiness for delivery. To calculate cycle time, teams must first establish the start and end points of the process they wish to measure. They then monitor the time taken for work items to move through this defined process. By recording the average, minimum, and maximum time to complete each item, the team gains a detailed understanding of their workflow.

This metric not only sheds light on the actual effort involved in producing functional software but also serves as a tool for process improvement. By analyzing cycle time, teams can pinpoint process bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and devise targeted strategies to enhance both efficiency and productivity.

Moreover, cycle time is customizable, allowing teams to account for the distinctive aspects of their work processes and project demands. This level of customization makes the metric particularly powerful for Agile teams, who can adapt their tracking and analysis to their specific operational needs and objectives. With a focus on refining cycle time, teams can accelerate the delivery of high-quality software, thereby meeting customer needs more effectively and ensuring a competitive edge in the market.
