#### Item Workspace Tour: Right Bar Features continued - Progress Tracking


DevStride's progress tracking shows the "percentage complete" of the item across the system. If the item has children, it reflects the percentage complete based on its children. 

DevStride provides the option of **manually indicating** the percentage of completeness as well. This might be important, for example, for an organization tracking an element of the project work that might be outside of their company, such as by a vendor, or outside their direct control. For these situations, you can manually track percentage complete by turning on the option and changing the percentage number (1).
