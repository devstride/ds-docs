## New Features and Improvements

### AI-Powered Description Templates

Reducing workload and creating consistency with DevStride just got even easier! You can now create custom AI-powered templates to help generate item descriptions. These templates support additional instructions to tailor the output to your specific needs.

### Gantt Enhancements
We’ve added several upgrades to the Gantt view:

Cycle Markers — Cycles are now visually represented in the Gantt chart, helping you stay aligned with your planning timelines.

Snapping Mode — Dragging items now snaps them across cycles, making scheduling more intuitive and efficient.

Cycles Column — A new Cycles column has been added to simplify navigation and provide better context in the Gantt view.

### Slack Integration UX
We improved the Slack integration interface, including easier connection management with add/remove functionality.

### Email Notification Template Content
Email notification templates now include richer, more relevant information to improve clarity and usefulness, including:

* Item title
* Email recipient's assigned role for the item

## Bug Fixes

### Subtask Scrolling

We fixed an issue where the view did not scroll down to the last subtask row when subtasks exceeded the visible screen area.

### Cycle Range & Sorting Issues
We resolved issues affecting cycle range calculations and task sorting behavior.

### Gantt Chart Progress Bars

We've updated the Gantt chart to more accurately reflect progress when users choose to update an individual item manually. Items that are set for manual tracking and are 0% complete now display a lightly shaded bar. As the percentage complete is increased, the bar fills in with a solid color—providing instant visual clarity on task status.
