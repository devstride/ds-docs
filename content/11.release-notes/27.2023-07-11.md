### New Features & Improvements

- **Better Notifications**
  - Email notifications for comments and replies will now include the full text of the comment or reply so you can do more without leaving your inbox! We went ahead and made it pretty to provide you with all the rich formatting you're used to.
  - Notifications will now also be marked as read when you open the email, so you can keep your DevStride Notification Center tidy.
- **Release Notes:** You can now view release notes for all the past and current releases of the app without leaving DevStride. Just click on the "Release Notes" link in the Help Center to see what's new!

### Bug Fixes & Minor Updates

- **Improved Workflow Runs:** Workflow runs are loaded on demand now which should provide a better experience for navigating through your workflow history.
- **Workspace and Quick Add Updates:** Changes will now be saved even when you close a tab or refresh the page, and we made some minor usability improvements in the Quick Add Dialog.
- **Better Date Management for Subtasks:** We improved how we handle dates for subtasks, including a fix for some date-related issues.

Please note, we've made some behind-the-scenes improvements for better performance and stability. Thank you for your ongoing support and feedback. We're looking forward to hearing what you think about this update!
