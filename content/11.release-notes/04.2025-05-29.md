In the <a href="https://app.devstride.com/devstride/organization/settings?section=lanes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Manage Statuses and WIP Limiters</a> section, you can now configure Item Types per status.

Interact with table views faster than ever! Full inline keyboard navigation with quick editing is now available for the following fields:

* Start Date field
* Due Date field
* Status field

This enhancement delivers Improved accessibility and efficiency with full keyboard navigation support, allowing users to make even quicker updates with the stroke of a key.

### Items Table Usability Improvements

* Minimum column width can now be set as low as 80 px.
* Sort icon now floats correctly to the right, regardless of the column label width.
* Fixed a column resizing bug that previously broke the grid layout.
* KNOWN ISSUE! Stored views saved prior to this fix will experience a visual alignment issue when choosing values that overflow the width of the column. You can fix the layout temporarily on screen by resizing the column, and you can fix this permanently by updating your saved view or saving a new view.

### General
Stability and performance improvements throughout the application.
 
### Improved Mobile Footer Rendering

Resolved a CSS issue affecting the footer display on mobile devices. The updated styling ensures the footer is now correctly positioned and fully visible, providing a smoother, more consistent mobile experience.
