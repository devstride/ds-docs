## 🆕 New Features

### Time Tracking in Item Drawer

#### - What's New?

We've introduced a Time Tracking tab in the item drawer. You can now log discrete time entries for multiple working sessions on a single item.

All entries are automatically aggregated in the TimeSpent field, giving you a clear, real-time view of total effort.

#### - Why It Matters

This feature enables accurate tracking for hourly billing and time-based reporting. Let us know what reporting capabilities would help you make the most of this enhancement.

#### - What's New?

We've improved the Time Entry form to give you more flexibility. By default, time entries will still be assigned to the user who logs them — but now you can choose a different contributor when needed.

This allows you to log time on behalf of a teammate or adjust ownership for better tracking.

#### - Why It Matters

Whether you’re a team lead managing entries or helping out a colleague, this update ensures accurate contributor tracking without extra steps.

Item Position Control in Map

#### - What's New?

When adding a new item or Workstream via the quick-add popup, you can now choose whether to insert it at the top or bottom of the map. A new checkbox gives you this control, and your preference is saved for the session.

The map will also auto-scroll to the newly added item if the list is long.

#### - Why It Matters

Some lists (like step-by-step guides) are more intuitive top-to-bottom. Others (like bug reports or requests) benefit from the most recent items at the top. This update gives you the flexibility to work your way.

## ✨ Improvements

### Keyboard Accessibility for Effort Points

#### - What's Improved?

The Effort Point cell in the [Items Table](https://app.devstride.com/devstride/items) is now fully keyboard-accessible. You can use the arrow keys to navigate like a spreadsheet and press any digit key to instantly update the value.

#### - Why It Matters

We're optimizing the grid view to deliver spreadsheet-level speed with the added power of DevStride’s intelligent inputs and modals. Expect more keyboard-first enhancements soon.

### Item Menus

#### - What's Changed?

Fixed spacing, size, and color of the right-click item menus.

#### - Why It Matters

We've added a lot of right-click controls over time, and the right-click menu needed some TLC. Enjoy the consistent layout, colors, and fonts for a smoother UX experience.

### Terminology Update: "Past Due" → "Overdue"

#### - What's Changed?

The label "Past Due" has been updated to "Overdue" across the UI.

#### - Why It Matters

User testing showed that "Overdue" improved comprehension speed and clarity. Small language updates like this help reduce cognitive load and create a smoother experience.

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### - What Was Fixed?

We resolved a previous issue in the forgot password flow.

#### - Why it Matters
