## New Features

### 📊 Database Access for BI Tools

Create any report you can imagine. With direct database access, you can connect modern BI tools like Metabase, Tableau, or Power BI to your DevStride data and build custom dashboards, cross-reference metrics, and generate insights tailored to your organization's unique needs—far beyond the stock reports available in DevStride.

Administrators and Owners can generate read-only PostgreSQL credentials with just a few clicks:

- **Connection Details Modal** - View and copy individual connection parameters (host, port, database, username, password, schema, SSL)
- **Secure credential storage** - Passwords are encrypted and can be revealed on demand
- **Credential management** - Rotate passwords or deactivate access at any time
- **Row-level security** - Your organization's data remains isolated and protected

Navigate to **Organization Settings > Database Access** to get started.

### 🎛️ Sidebar Field Customization in Item Drawer

Your team's workflow is unique—now your item drawer can match. Tailor the sidebar to show exactly what matters most for each work type, putting critical information front and center while reducing clutter from fields you rarely use. Not every stock field makes sense for every item type—now you can hide them entirely rather than leaving empty or irrelevant fields taking up space.

- **Reorder fields** - Drag and drop to arrange sidebar fields in your preferred order
- **Hide fields** - Remove stock or custom fields you don't need from the sidebar view
- **Promote custom fields** - Elevate individual custom fields to top-level sidebar fields for quicker access

Configure field order in **Organization Settings > Work Types**.

### ⏱️ End Time in Time Entries Table

The Time Entries table now displays an **End** column showing when each time entry was completed, making it easier to review time tracking data at a glance.

### 📋 Member Users Can Create Boards

Users with Member permissions can now create perpetual boards directly from the Boards page. Previously, board creation was restricted to Admin users. Cycle board creation remains admin-only.

## Improvements

- Improved column sizing in the Time Entries table with responsive widths
- Renamed "Date Started" column to "Start" for consistency with the new "End" column
