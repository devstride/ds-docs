## New Features

### Grouping Gantt Charts and Automations
You can now group your Gantt charts and automations in a way that suits your needs, making it easier to keep everything organized.

## Bug Fixes and Enhancements

### Item Management
We fixed an issue where some options (like deleting) weren’t showing up in the right-click menu after archiving items. Now, everything updates as expected!

### Shortcuts
There was a problem where the "I" key, when searching for dependencies, was clashing with adding new child items. This has been resolved to ensure smooth item creation.

### Real-time Updates
Archived items weren’t showing changes immediately, but now everything updates in real-time right after archiving.
