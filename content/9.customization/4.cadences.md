## Managing Cadences

Cadences in DevStride are a way to manage and track different phases or iterations of work such as sprints, cycles, or any other time-boxed events. The cadences allow teams to plan their work in a structured way. Here's how you can manage your cadences:

## Accessing Cadences

2. Under the `DATA MODEL` section, click on `Cadences`.


## Adding a New Planning Cadence

To create a new planning cadence:

1. In the `PLANNING CADENCES` section, click on the `New Planning Cadence` button.
2. A pop-up window will appear titled `NEW PLANNING CADENCE`.

## Configuring a New Planning Cadence

When creating a new cadence, you need to configure the following:

- **LABEL**: Enter a descriptive name for the cadence.
- **NEW TIMEBOX EVERY**: Choose the interval at which a new timebox (iteration) will occur (e.g., every 2 weeks).
- **FREQUENCY UNIT**: Select the time unit for the interval (e.g., Week, Month).
- **TIMEBOX LABEL TEMPLATE**: Create a label template for your timeboxes using the provided variables such as `${label}`, `${counter}`, `${year}`, etc.

## Setting Parent Cadence (Optional)

- If your new cadence is part of a larger cadence, you can select a parent cadence from the `PARENT CADENCE` dropdown.

## Choosing Cadence Color

- Select a color for your cadence to make it visually distinctive on the planning board.

## Saving the Cadence

- Once all information is filled out, click `Create Cadence` to save your new cadence.

## Viewing and Editing Cadences
