## Filters in the "Automations" Section of DevStride

The **Automations** section in DevStride is a robust feature that allows teams to streamline their workflow by setting up rules that automatically trigger based on specific criteria. To help manage and find specific automations, you can use filters. This document explains how to apply these filters.

## Accessing Filters

To access filters within the Automations section:

1. Navigate to the **Automations** section from the sidebar.
2. Click on the `Filters` button located in the top-right corner of the Automations dashboard.

## Available Filters

The filters in the Automations section help you to display only those automations that meet certain conditions:

- **Trigger**: Filter automations based on the trigger event, such as the creation of a work item, a status update, or a particular tag being added.
- **Condition Field**: Display automations that check for certain conditions before executing.
- **Action**: Filter by the action that the automation performs, like changing a status or updating a field.
- **Status**: Show automations based on whether they are currently enabled or disabled.
- **Created By**: Filter automations by the user who created them.

## Applying Filters

To apply a filter:

1. Click on the `Filters` button to expand the filters menu.
2. Select the filter you wish to apply, such as Trigger, Action, or Created By.
3. Choose the specific criteria from the dropdown or selection list.
4. The list of automations will update to show only those that match the selected filter(s).

## Clearing Filters

To clear the applied filters and view all automations:

1. Click the `Filters` button again.
2. Click on the `Clear` button inside the filters dropdown to remove all filters at once.
3. Alternatively, click the `X` next to individual filter tags at the top of the automation list to remove them one by one.

The automations list will then reset to show all available automations without the filter criteria.
