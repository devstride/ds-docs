### Setting Up Your Organization in DevStride


In DevStride, your Organization is the top-level container that houses your functions, initiatives, and teams. 

As an admin, you’ll create your organization first, and then configure how projects, teams, and workflows are structured within it.

<br>
Your DevStride is essentially a blank slate at the beginning. You can start fresh or integrate with your existing tools.


For ease of onboarding, this guide is divided into "capability-by-capability" instructions, with the links to the next step at the bottom of the page. 

Setting up each capability generally takes just a few minutes to complete.

Together, these steps will equip your organization with powerful project and portfolio management capabilities.

#### Step 2: **Create Your Organization**
Once you have created your login, you will need to set up DevStride for your company. Your company's instance of DevStride is called an Organization.

You only need to set up one organization, regardless of how many teams or projects you are managing. 

**How to do it**
Click on the **DevStride** link in the lower left corner (1). Next, click Create Organization (2).

The **Create Organization** box will pop up.

Fill in the **Organization Name** field. You can name it anything you want. 

We suggest using your company name and uploading your logo.

**Notes on Users**

* Adding your domain here helps match up your internal users to your instance of DevStride once they are invited. 

* You can invite users directly from this screen or later on in Settings > Organization Org Configuration.
* You can also invite external users.


Once you have filled in the Create an Organization pop-up, click **Create Organization.**


<br>
Next, you will see the **Organization Configuration** screen.
<br>
This screen allows you to fill in additional details about your organization. 

The Profile section can be completed now or later. (1)

The Workflow Automation section can be set to the default for now. (2)
