#### Understanding the Big Picture — with DevStride

Unify work across every team, project, product, and initiative into an integrated portfolio.

From the highest level of your work initiatives to executing the work itself, DevStride delivers context, control, and predictability like never before. 

DevStride's Portfolio Workstreams provide a map of value, boards create an execution hierarchy, and gantts create timelines wherever needed. These are all related to teach other an in a coherent data model.


#### A Portfolio Map to Guide Your Way


DevStride’s Portfolio Map centralizes activity across your organization into a clear, structured hierarchy. 

Fragmented projects are transformed into integrated workstreams to ensure seamless alignment across projects, teams, and initiatives.

A fully configurable taxonomy with rich data translation enables unified visibility across the entire portfolio of work.




#### Setting Up your Portfolio Map: Workstreams

Now it's time to start identifying the work your organization is going to do. Within the Portfolio Map, we call these **Workstreams**. This is a key concept in DevStride.
:::(Info) (Workstreams: A Fundamental Concept)

In any organization where there is a lot of activity, there is a need to organize that activity. Workstreams are a way to organize all your activities in one place.

DevStride has a **dual approach to organizing activities**. One is through its use of **Workstreams**. And the other is through **Boards**. We will talk about Boards later. First, we'll talk about Workstreams.

**Workstreams** **are a hierarchical organization of effort.** This is often referred to as a functional taxonomy. It's the idea of taking big concepts of work and breaking them down into smaller and smaller concepts until they eventually break down into individual tasks for the users.

A Workstream Map is a visual layout of your organization’s workstreams (these could be initiatives, functional groups, programs, product lines, and/or projects). The Workstream Map shows how different streams of work relate to each other. 

Here's an example using of what a workstream map can look like. Every workstream map uniquely reflects the organization using it:
