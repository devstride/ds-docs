## Using Item Types in a Workstream

## Item Types Explained
Here is a brief description of each 'Item Type' you might encounter:

- **General**: Use this for miscellaneous tasks that don't fit into other specific categories.
- **Compliance Task**: For tasks that are related to compliance and regulatory requirements.
- **Module**: If you're working on a particular section of a project, categorize your task under this.
- **Capability**: For tasks aimed at adding new capabilities or features.
- **Epic**: Larger, more complex tasks that span multiple sprints or iterations.
- **Defect**: Use this to report bugs or issues that need to be addressed.
- **Story**: Tasks that deliver a piece of work which contributes to the value of the workstream's output.

## Creating an Item with a Specific Item Type

1. Click on the green "+" sign in the workstream to which you want to add an item.
2. In the 'Create an Item' pop-up:
    - **Title**: Enter a descriptive title for the task.
    - **Location**: This should default to your current workstream but check to make sure.
    - **Item Type**: Select from the dropdown menu the type that best describes the task you are adding.
3. After filling out the necessary information, click 'Save New Item' to add the task to the workstream.

## Best Practices for Using Item Types
- **Consistency**: Always use the same item type for similar tasks to maintain consistency within the workstream.
- **Clarity**: Choose the item type that most accurately reflects the nature of the task for better clarity.
- **Communication**: If unsure about which item type to use, communicate with your team or supervisor for guidance.
