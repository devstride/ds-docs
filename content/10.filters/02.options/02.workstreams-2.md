## Managing Options in Workstreams

In Devstride's "Workstreams" section, you can tailor your view and interaction with workstream items. This guide explains how to use the options to customize your experience.

## Accessing Workstream Options

1. Go to the **Workstreams** section, accessible from the left-hand navigation menu.
2. At the top-right corner of the screen, you'll find the `Options` button. Click on it to open the options menu.

## Customizing Workstream Views

The options menu provides several customization features:

### Line Wrap

- Toggle the `Line Wrap` switch to enable or disable the wrapping of text in the items list. This can help you manage the visibility of long text entries.

### Hide Completion Stats Icon

- The `Hide Completion Stats Icon` option allows you to show or hide the completion statistics for each workstream item. Turning this off can simplify the view if you prefer not to see these stats.

### Creating New Workstream or Item

- Use the `New Workstream` button to create a new category or grouping of work within your project.
- The `New Item` button allows you to add new tasks or activities to your workstreams.

### Organizing Workstreams

- Each workstream can be expanded or collapsed by clicking the arrow next to the workstream name.
- Inside each workstream, items can also be expanded to view more details or collapsed to save space.

## Applying Custom Options

After adjusting your options:

1. Your settings will be applied immediately to the workstream view.
2. The interface will reflect your preferences without the need to save manually.

## Resetting Options

To reset your view to the default settings:

- Navigate back to the `Options` menu.
- Switch off any toggles you previously set.
- Your view will revert to the standard layout.
