## Filters in the "My Work" Section of DevStride

The **My Work** section in DevStride provides a powerful filtering system to help you manage and prioritize your tasks efficiently. Below is a guide on how to use filters to streamline your workflow.

## Accessing Filters

To access the filters:

1. Navigate to the **My Work** section.
2. Click on the `Filters` button located in the toolbar at the top of the list.

## Available Filters

Once you click on the `Filters` button, you will see a dropdown with the following options to narrow down your view:

- **Item Type**: Filter tasks based on their type (e.g., Story, Epic, Task, etc.).
- **Team**: Select tasks assigned to specific teams.
- **Priority**: Choose tasks based on their priority level.
- **Tag**: Display tasks that are tagged with specific keywords or labels.
- **Field**: Filter by custom fields that are relevant to your items.
- **Cycle**: Look at tasks assigned to specific development cycles.

## Applying Filters

To apply a filter:

1. Click on the desired filter category in the dropdown.
2. A submenu will appear with different options. Select the one that suits your needs.
3. The task list will update automatically to reflect the chosen filter(s).

## Multiple Filters

You can apply multiple filters at once to further refine your task list:

1. After applying the first filter, click on the `Filters` button again.
2. Choose another category and select an option.
3. The list will now show items that meet all the selected criteria.

## Clearing Filters

To remove applied filters and return to the unfiltered view in DevStride, you have two options:

1. **Clear Individual Filters**: 
   - Each applied filter appears as a tag near the top of the section. 
   - Click the `X` on a filter tag to remove that specific filter.

2. **Clear Filters from the Filter Menu**: 
   - For specific that have a detailed filter menu, you can clear selections directly within the menu. 
   - Open the filter by clicking on it, and then click the `Clear` button within the filter menu to remove the selections for that specific filter.

After clearing filters, the view will update to show all items or notifications, depending on the section you are in.

Remember that clearing filters can help you reset your view to its default state, allowing you to start a new search or overview of all items.
