## Filters in the "Cycles" Section of DevStride

The **Cycles** section in DevStride organizes work into specific time frames, helping teams manage their tasks in an agile manner. The Filters feature enhances the management by allowing users to view tasks based on various criteria. Below is how to utilize filters within this section.

## Accessing Filters

To use the filters in the Cycles section:

1. Go to the **Cycles** section on the sidebar.
2. Click the `Filters` button located at the top of the page, next to the `Sort` and `Options` buttons.

## Types of Filters Available

In the **Cycles** section, filters can be applied based on the following criteria:

- **Team**: Show tasks assigned to a particular team.
- **Cycle**: Display tasks within a specific development cycle.
- **Parent**: Filter tasks that are sub-items of a parent task.
- **Item Type**: Differentiate tasks by their type (e.g., Story, Bug, Epic).
- **Assignee**: View tasks assigned to specific team members.
- **Priority**: Filter tasks by priority level (e.g., High, Normal, Low).
- **Tag**: See tasks associated with certain tags.
- **Field**: Use custom fields to filter tasks.
- **Start Date**: Filter tasks based on their start date.
- **Due Date**: Show tasks according to their due date.
- **Time Spent**: Look for tasks based on the amount of time spent on them.

## Applying Filters

To apply a filter:

1. Click the `Filters` button to reveal the dropdown menu.
2. Choose the desired filter category.
3. Select the specific criteria from the expanded list.
4. The task list in the Cycles section will update to reflect the chosen filters.

## Combining Filters

You can refine your task list by combining different filters:

1. After applying the initial filter, reopen the `Filters` menu.
2. Select another filter category and its criteria.
3. The task list will now display items that match all the selected filters.

## Clearing Filters

To remove applied filters and return to the unfiltered view in DevStride, you have two options:

1. **Clear Individual Filters**: 
   - Each applied filter appears as a tag near the top of the section. 
   - Click the `X` on a filter tag to remove that specific filter.

2. **Clear Filters from the Filter Menu**: 
   - For specific that have a detailed filter menu, you can clear selections directly within the menu. 
   - Open the filter by clicking on it, and then click the `Clear` button within the filter menu to remove the selections for that specific filter.

After clearing filters, the view will update to show all items or notifications, depending on the section you are in.

Remember that clearing filters can help you reset your view to its default state, allowing you to start a new search or overview of all items.

## Summary

Using filters in the Cycles section effectively can greatly contribute to a streamlined and focused workflow, enabling team members to prioritize and track their tasks throughout the development cycle.
