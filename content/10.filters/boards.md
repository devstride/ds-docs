## Filters in the "Boards" Section of DevStride

The **Boards** section in DevStride provides a visual representation of your team's tasks and their progress. Filters in this section help you to narrow down and focus on specific items based on various criteria. The following documentation will guide you through using filters in the Boards section.

## Accessing Filters

To access filters on the Boards:

1. Open the **Boards** section from the sidebar navigation.
2. Click on the `Filters` button located in the top-right corner, next to the `Sort` and `Options` buttons.

## Types of Filters Available

In the Boards section, you can apply filters based on the following:

- **Parent**: Show tasks that are sub-tasks of a parent item.
- **Item Type**: Filter tasks by their type, such as Story, Bug, or Epic.
- **Assignee**: Display tasks assigned to specific team members.
- **Priority**: Sort tasks by priority level like High, Medium, or Low.
- **Tag**: View tasks associated with specific tags.
- **Field**: Filter by custom fields created for items on the board.
- **Start Date**: Filter tasks based on when they were started.
- **Due Date**: View tasks by their due dates.
- **Time Spent**: See tasks based on the time logged against them.

## Applying Filters

To apply a filter:

1. Click on the `Filters` button to reveal the dropdown menu.
2. Select the desired filter category.
3. Choose the specific criteria you want to apply.
4. The board will update to only show items that match the selected filters.

## Combining Filters

For a more refined view, you can apply multiple filters simultaneously:

1. Apply the first filter as detailed above.
2. Click on the `Filters` button again and select another filter category.
3. The board will now reflect items that meet all the chosen criteria.

## Clearing Filters

To clear the applied filters:

1. To remove an individual filter, click the `X` on the filter tag that is displayed at the top of the board.

This will reset the board to its original state, showing all items without any filters.
