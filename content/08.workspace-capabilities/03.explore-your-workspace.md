## Workspace
The workspace in DevStride is the central hub where users can create, edit, and manage all components of a work item. Once a work item is created, the workspace offers a range of options to configure and oversee the item's details.

## Header
The header is situated at the top of the workspace and contains essential information about the work item.

### Structure of the Header

- **Indicator Icon**: Positioned at the top left, it shows the work item's status (e.g., Planned, Completed).
- **ID**: The unique identifier starting with "I" followed by digits. It can be used to search for the item within DevStride.
- **Title**: A succinct and descriptive name for the work item, searchable within the platform.
- **Edit Icon**: A pencil icon next to the title allowing for quick editing of the work item's name.
- **Link Icon**: Next to the Edit icon, used for copying the item's link to share or save.

## Priority Levels
- **Priority Levels**: To set the priority of a work item, click the Priority button found in the upper right corner of the workspace. Priorities are customizable and can be altered in the Config page.

## Chevron
- **Chevron**: This symbol beside the Priority button is for saving and exiting the workspace, ensuring all changes are kept.

## Workstream
- **Workstream**: It categorizes efforts within your organization. You can access and modify a workstream from the workspace by clicking the Select Workstream icon.

## Breadcrumb

Located in the second row, the breadcrumb trail displays the path of the work item through various workstreams. Clicking a node in the breadcrumb navigates directly to that location in the Map.

## Right Control Bar

This sidebar allows you to manage various attributes of the work item:

### Participants

- Shows who created and who is assigned to the item.

### Tags

- Add tags such as 'Bug' to categorize the item.

### Assignment and Priority

- Assign team members and set the item's priority level.

### Values

- Configure point estimates, time estimates, due dates, cycles, lanes, goals, and tags.

## Descriptions

Descriptions are supported by a rich Text Editor for clear content creation, with features like:

- Quick formatting
- @mentions
- Drag & drop for media
- Quick links

## Comments

Collaborate through comments, which include:

- Threads
- Reactions
- @mentions

Providing context and a linear history of interactions.

## Assets

Organize external resources related to the item. Assets can be files or URLs, and children items inherit parent assets.

### Attaching an Asset

- Attach assets via drag and drop to the Map view, into the description field, or directly onto the Assets stage in the Assets tab.

### Managing Groups and Assets

- Assets are sorted into groups, with the ability to create custom groups for better organization.
- Manage these groups by renaming or deleting, and manage assets with actions like Open, Get Info, Rename, & Delete.

## Subtasks

Create subtasks within the workspace to break down tasks into smaller, actionable items, assigning them individually for better tracking and management.

## Activity

The Activity log offers a detailed history of all interactions with a work item, including changes, who made them, and when.

## How to Use Activity

- Access the **Activity** tab to view a comprehensive log.
- Filter and sort records, and view changes in a diff format for a better understanding of modifications over time.
