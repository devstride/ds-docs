## New Features and Improvements


### 🆕 Published Lists are Here!
We’ve introduced Published Lists — a powerful new way to share filtered item views with external stakeholders like clients, contractors, or contributors. This feature makes it easy to expose curated sets of data without requiring access to your internal workspace.  

#### Example use cases:

* Share a list of active support issues with a client.
* Share a prioritized public backlog with open-source contributors or advisors.
* Provide a real-time view of deliverables for external project collaborators.

#### How to Publish a List:

**To create a publicly shareable list:**

1. Navigate to the [Manage Items](https://app.devstride.com/devstride/items){target=`_blank`} module.
Apply at least one filter using the control ribbon to narrow your list.
Click the new “Publish” button in the control ribbon.
Enter a name and description to provide context to viewers.
Under visibility settings, choose “Visible outside the organization.”
Click “Save View.”
Your new Published List is now created!

2. Share Your List.

    Click the Published tab to view your saved lists.
    Select the list you just created.
    Click the link icon to copy the public URL.
    Share this URL with clients, collaborators, or external contributors — no login         required.
    
    
## ✨ Enhancements
#### Visual updates across the app

* **Improved theming** support, updated dark theme, updated loading screens

#### Restore Descriptions
Users can now restore an Item Description from a previous state in the Activity Log.

#### Import .CSV to Custom Field
Users can now import a .csv file to populate the options in a "Text Options List" or a "Number Options List." This helps users import and sync long lists of tracking values such as a list of customers.
