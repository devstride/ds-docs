### Revolutionizing DevStride: Fresh Navigation, Enhanced Gantt Features, and More!

We’re thrilled to present our latest updates to DevStride, reinforcing our commitment to providing a seamless project management experience. Dive in and discover what’s new!

#### New Features and Enhancements

**Revamped navigation**: We have a brand new navigation! Say goodbye to the old Work and Plan view. Now, it’s all about simplicity! Use the new View Switcher for an intuitive navigation experience. Welcome to flatter, streamlined navigation that prioritizes user efficiency.

**Gantt Enhancements**:
- Prominent Queued Updates: Easily identify queued updates in Gantt views, ensuring that no crucial information gets missed.
- Data Safety Guards: We’ve added safeguards to prevent unintended data loss when navigating away from the Gantt view.
- Smarter Date Inferences: DevStride now offers better inferred dates for workstreams, aiding in more accurate planning.

**Asset Management Improvements**:

- Copy Asset URLs: Easily access and copy the URLs of your assets directly from the platform.
- Flexible Linking: We’ve improved our link validation! Now, DevStride can accept links that may appear malformed but are still valid, ensuring no hitches when linking assets.
- Churn Refinements: Our Churn terminology has been updated for clarity! ‘Planned/Unplanned’ is now labeled as ‘Added/Removed’. Dive deeper with more granular insights when assessing a single cycle’s churn.
- Completion Stats Update: For those using the map, the embedded completion stats have been removed. To view completion stats, simply use the tooltip or opt for right-clicking and selecting “show completion stats.”

#### Bug Fixes

We’ve addressed some reported bugs to enhance your DevStride experience. These include fixes related to Gantt renaming, validation hints for cycle and board creation, and more.
