## New Features

### Organize Custom Fields Into Forms
You are now able to organize custom fields that you will use in Forms into a group specific to those Forms, separating them from other Custom Fields that you may use in other ways. 

For Custom Fields that you have grouped into custom Collections, they will be available under a new **Forms** tab in work items of the Item Type that you associate these Custom Fields Collections with. 

Check out our docs on [Custom Fields](/v1/docs/custom-fields) and [Item Request Forms](/v1/docs/item-request-forms) for more details! 

## Bug Fixes and Enhancements
