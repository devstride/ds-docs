## Gantt Charts Toolbar

### Select a Chart

When selecting a Gantt chart from the dropdown menu, it is important to consider the specific needs and requirements of your project. The Gantt chart is a powerful visual tool that helps in project management by illustrating the timeline of tasks, their dependencies, and progress.

### Zoom Levels

adjusting zoom levels allows users to view project timelines at varying levels of granularity, catering to their specific needs and preferences.
users can effortlessly switch between different time scales, ranging from the broadest perspective of Years down to the most detailed view of Days.

- Years: When zoomed out to Years, the Gantt chart presents an overall picture of long-term project milestones and durations.
- Quarters: Zooming into Quarters enables a closer examination of quarterly progress and deadlines.
- Months: Zooming into Months provides a more detailed breakdown of monthly tasks and timelines.
- Weeks: Weeks offer a more granular view, allowing users to closely monitor weekly project activities.
- Days: Lastly, the finest level of granularity is achieved by zooming into Days, which allows for real-time tracking of daily project progress, task dependencies, and critical paths.

### Full Screen

To view a Gantt chart in full-screen mode, simply click the dedicated full-screen button located on the toolbar.

### Linked and Unlinked Mode

Enabling Linked Mode in the Gantt chart's toolbar establishes a connection
between dependent tasks, ensuring changes made to one task automatically
cascade to linked tasks. This synchronization enhances efficiency and reduces the risk of overlooking
critical interdependencies.

Item actions will propagate down the dependency chain, updating start and end dates,
durations, and other task attributes accordingly. Switching between linked and unlinked modes is effortless, as users can toggle the setting using the convenient
keyboard shortcut Command Shift + M.

### Show Bar Progress

Gantt charts offer various options to visualize project progress through the representation of bar progress.

- "Items completed," displays bars that dynamically fill up as tasks or project milestones are accomplished, providing a clear and visually appealing indication of completed work.
- "Point Estimate," showcases the planned or expected progress based on predefined estimates, allowing users to compare planned versus actual progress easily.
- "Time Estimate," illustrates the progress based on the time taken to complete tasks, giving a realistic view of project advancement in terms of time spent.
- Lastly, the "Hide Progress" option allows users to hide the bar progress altogether, useful when focusing on other aspects of the Gantt chart or for presenting a more simplified view of the project timeline.

### Collapse and Expand

To find the bulk collapse and expand buttons in the Gantt chart toolbar, look for icons or labels representing the collapse and expand functionalities, situated near the "Show Bar Progress" by section of the toolbar.

The collapsing and expanding function in DevStride's Gantt chart offers valuable benefits that enhance project management and communication. By collapsing initiatives, project managers and teams can achieve improved visual clarity and focus on the most relevant details. For instance, in a large software development project with multiple sub-projects and tasks, collapsing initiatives allows the Gantt chart to present a higher-level view, making it easier to grasp the overall project structure and timeline. This helps project managers quickly identify critical milestones and potential dependencies without getting overwhelmed by excessive details. When reviewing the project's progress with stakeholders during a meeting, collapsing initiatives enables the team to present a concise and clear overview, facilitating better understanding and engagement.

On the other hand, expanding initiatives provides an opportunity for expectation transparency and comprehensive status updates. For example, when managing a marketing campaign with several marketing channels as initiatives, expanding each initiative reveals the underlying tasks and activities. This level of detail allows project teams to assess the status of each marketing channel, identify potential bottlenecks or delays, and allocate resources accordingly. Furthermore, when sharing updates with stakeholders, expanding initiatives offers a detailed picture of the progress made in each area, allowing stakeholders to have a comprehensive understanding of the project's current status. This transparency promotes trust and confidence among stakeholders and ensures that everyone is on the same page regarding project progress and challenges.

In summary, utilizing the collapsing and expanding function in DevStride's Gantt chart optimizes visual representation, improves communication, and enhances project management. By leveraging these functions, project managers can efficiently manage large projects, present clear and concise updates to stakeholders, and ensure that projects progress smoothly towards successful completion.

**Collapse**

The ability to bulk collapse initiatives and workstreams by levels enables users to
condense multiple levels of workstreams and initiatives simultaneously,
providing a more concise and structured view of the project.

By selecting a specific level or hierarchy, such as all
initiatives or workstreams under a particular category, users can collapse these elements with a single action, eliminating the need to individually collapse each one.

**Expand**


The ability to expand different workstreams at various levels in a Gantt chart allows
users to selectively drill down into specific workstreams to reveal more detailed tasks and sub-tasks,
while keeping other workstreams at higher levels of abstraction.
By expanding workstreams individually, users can focus on particular areas of interest
or critical project components, gaining a comprehensive understanding of their progress and dependencies.
