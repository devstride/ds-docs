## Gantt Chart

A visual representation of the project schedule, showing tasks, durations, dependencies, milestones, and other relevant information.

## Task

A specific activity or work item that needs to be completed in a project.

## Start and End Date

**Start Date:** The date when a task is scheduled to begin.

**End Date:** The date when a task is scheduled to be completed.

## Dependencies
The relationships between tasks that determine the order in which they must be completed. A task can have one or more predecessors (tasks that must be completed before it) and/or successors (tasks that cannot begin until it is complete).

## Milestone
A significant event or achievement that marks a major stage in the project. Milestones are usually represented as diamonds in a Gantt chart.

## Critical Path

The sequence of tasks that must be completed on time in order to finish the project on schedule. Any delays in a critical path task will cause a delay in the overall project schedule.

## Slack/Float

The amount of time a task can be delayed without affecting the project schedule. Tasks with no slack are considered critical and must be completed on time.

## Resource Allocation

The assignment of people, equipment, and other resources to tasks in a project.

## Progress Tracking

The process of monitoring and updating the status of tasks in a project. This helps to identify delays or potential problems and take corrective action.

## Baseline

The original project plan, including task durations and start/end dates. The baseline is used as a reference point for tracking progress and measuring
