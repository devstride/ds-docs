## How-To Guide: Conducting a Standup in a Portfolio Management Tool
### Step-by-Step Process:

#### 1. Preparation:
   - **Schedule the Meeting:** Use the portfolio management tool to set a recurring daily meeting at a consistent time. Ensure the tool sends automated reminders to all team members.
   - **Template Creation:** Develop a template within the tool for standup updates. This template should include sections for yesterday’s achievements, today’s goals, and current obstacles.

#### 2. Conducting the Standup:
   - **Start on Time:** Begin the meeting at the scheduled time, using the tool’s meeting link or integrated video call feature. Activate the meeting’s timer function to keep track of the 15-minute limit.
   - **Round-Robin Updates:** Proceed in a round-robin fashion, with each team member sharing their updates based on the predefined template. Encourage standing up if the meeting's format allows, to maintain engagement and brevity.
   - **Use the Tool for Visual Support:** Display the portfolio management tool’s dashboard on the screen, if possible, to visually track progress, goals, and obstacles as each member speaks.
   - **Documenting Updates:** As each member speaks, either the speaker or a designated scribe should enter the updates directly into the portfolio management tool. This ensures real-time tracking and allows team members who cannot attend to stay informed.

#### 3. Goal Setting and Obstacle Identification:
   - **Set Daily Goals:** After updating on progress, each member should outline their goals for the day in the tool, setting clear expectations and fostering accountability.
   - **Highlight Obstacles:** When discussing obstacles, use the tool’s feature to tag or highlight these issues for visibility. Assign tasks or discussions as needed to address these obstacles, scheduling follow-ups directly within the tool.

#### 4. Wrap-Up:
   - **Review and Confirm:** Quickly review the updates, goals, and identified obstacles for clarity and understanding. Confirm any action items and responsibilities assigned to address obstacles.
   - **Conclude on Time:** Ensure the meeting concludes within the 15-minute timeframe to respect everyone’s time and maintain efficiency.

#### 5. Post-Meeting:
   - **Access and Action:** All team members should have access to the standup notes and updates within the portfolio management tool. Encourage the team to review the day’s goals and any unresolved obstacles after the meeting.
   - **Track Progress:** Utilize the tool’s tracking features to monitor progress on daily goals and obstacle resolution throughout the day.

### Best Practices:

- **Maintain Discipline:** Adhere strictly to the schedule and format to cultivate a habit of efficiency and focus among the team.
- **Encourage Engagement:** Even in a virtual setup, find ways to make the standup interactive and engaging to keep team morale high.
- **Leverage Technology:** Fully utilize the features of the portfolio management tool for scheduling, reminders, tracking, and documenting to streamline the standup process.
- **Focus on Solutions:** While identifying obstacles is crucial, encourage a solutions-oriented discussion to foster a proactive and positive team environment.

This how-to guide aims to empower teams to conduct effective and efficient standup meetings within a portfolio management tool, enhancing communication, productivity, and overall project success.
