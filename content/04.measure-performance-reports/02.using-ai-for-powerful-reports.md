## 📍How to Use AI in DevStride Reports

Leverage built-in AI to analyze your data and surface actionable insights.

### Step-by-Step Instructions
#### 1. Navigate to Reports

Go to the left sidebar and click the “Measure Performance” module.

#### 2. Choose a Report

Open any available report (e.g., Current Progress, Cycle Time, Burn Down).

#### 3. Under "Filters" Look for the AI Assistant

Locate the AI icon.

#### 4. Create a prompt. 
For example, you might want to find out what a specific team member worked on in June. In the AI prompt, you could simply write, "What did Shend [as an example] work on in June?" 


#### 5. Click the AI button and wait for it to process.

The AI will analyze the report data based on the filters it infers from your prompt and surface a report to address your specific prompt.

#### 6. Interact or Refine

You can edit filters and re-run AI to get updated insights.

#### 7. Interact, Export, or Share

You can drill into individual items from the reports to examine or interact with them. You can also export or share the results.
