## Overview

* * *
In DevStride, a churn report is a metric that is used to measure the amount of work that is added or removed from a cycle during a specific period.

The term "churn" refers to the amount of work that is added, removed, or changed during the course of a cycle.

In Agile, the focus is on delivering working software quickly and efficiently, and churn reports can help teams track their progress toward that goal.

Churn reports can provide insight into the number of changes or revisions that are being made to a project during development. This information can help teams understand the complexity of the work being done, identify potential roadblocks or issues, and adjust their approach as needed.

Churn reports can also help Agile teams identify areas where they may need to improve their processes or communication. For example, if a high number of changes are being made late in the development cycle, it may indicate that requirements were not well understood or communicated at the outset.
