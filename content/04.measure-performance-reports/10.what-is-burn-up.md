## Overview

* * *
A Burn Up chart is a project management tool used to track progress towards completing a project or achieving a specific goal. The chart shows how much work has been completed and how much work is left to be done over time.

Unlike a Burn Down chart, which shows the amount of work remaining on a project at any given point in time, a Burn Up chart shows the total amount of work completed over time. The chart has two lines: the first line shows the total amount of work required to complete the project, while the second line shows the actual amount of work completed over time.

The goal of a Burn Up chart is to help project managers track progress towards completing the project or goal and to ensure that the project is completed on time. By comparing the actual amount of work completed to the total amount of work required, project managers can identify areas where they need to focus their efforts in order to complete the project on time.

In summary, a Burn Up chart is a visual representation of the progress made towards completing a project or achieving a specific goal. It helps project managers track progress and identify areas for improvement.
