## Overview

* * *

Current Progress refers to the current state of completion of the project or cycle at a given point in time. In DevStride, Current Progress is measured by the number of items or tasks that have been completed, and the amount of work remaining.

Current Progress is a snapshot of the project's current status and is used to inform decisions and plan the next steps.
